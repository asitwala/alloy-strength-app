        question: 'What is Autoregulation?',
        answer: `
        <p>
            Autoregulatory training is a system based on an individual athlete’s physiological and mental state, automatically configuring programming variables to the athlete’s specific needs at the time. This method attempts to adjust for athlete's adaptations, allowing for increases in load and strength at an individual pace by catering training stress to daily performance measures. This allows for complete personalization even within a structured program. You can learn more about autoregulation on our <a href="http://blog.electrumperformance.com/">blog</a>.

        question: 'What is the Levels Progression?',
        answer: `
        <p>
            The levels progression is the exercise progression used in Electrum Performance’s training system. Rather than having a “back and biceps” or “legs” or “arms and abs” training day, we are concerned with training the global movement patterns our body can perform. For each compound pattern and associated accessories, there are 25 increasingly-challenging levels. Each microcycle, or 1-month block of training, presents a chance to “level up” and move on to the next level.
