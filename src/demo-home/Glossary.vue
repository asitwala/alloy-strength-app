                                    Autoregulatory training is a system based on an individual athlete’s physiological and mental state,
                                    automatically configuring programming variables to the athlete’s specific needs at the time. This method
                                    attempts to adjust for athlete's adaptations, allowing for increases in load and strength at an individual
                                    pace by catering training stress to daily performance measures. This allows for complete personalization
                                    even within a structured program.

                                    The levels progression is the exercise progression used in Alloy Strength’s training system. Rather than having a “back and biceps” or “legs” or “arms and abs” training day, we are concerned with training the
                                    global movement patterns our body can perform. For each compound pattern and associated
                                    global movement patterns our body can perform. For each compound pattern and associated
                                    accessories, there are 25 increasingly-challenging levels. Each microcycle, or 1-month block of training,
                                    presents a chance to “level up” and move on to the next level.

                                <p>A Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale is a method used in autoregulatory training to determine
                                exercise set intensity, or how hard something feels to you at the time. The scale used in our Levels
                                Progression is 1-10, with a 1 signifying “little to no effort” and a 10 signifying “maximum effort”. The
                                scale also refers to the number of repetitions short of failure for each set, or Repetitions in Reserve
                                (RIR). A 9 RPE would mean 1 repetition short of failure (1 RIR), and a 7.5 meaning 2-3 RIR.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                RPE scales can often be more appropriate than percentage based programming (selecting weights as a
                                percentage of your 1 repetition max). There are many things that can throw off your percentages, such
                                as strength adaptations in a training block, training history, physical illness, sleep quality, diet, mental
                                stress, and a myriad of other factors. Life happens, and you can’t always be at your best; RPE can
                                account for these variables, allowing you to regulate training based on how hard a weight or exercise
                                feels that day.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Each exercise set has a desired RPE, listed underneath the exercise on your Strength Card. For each set,
                                you will select a weight or number of repetitions to perform to attempt to coincide with the desired
                                RPE. Ultimately, it is up to you to listen to your body and honestly determine RPE values for that
                                particular training session, regardless of past performance. Being honest with yourself is the most
                                important part of using the RPE scale, and will allow for far more effective training results.

                                    not listed in your strength card, and it is up to you to determine how to best prepare yourself to train.
                                    1-3 warm up sets with higher repetitions than your working sets is a good rule of thumb.

                                <p>There are many ways to prepare, or “warm-up”, prior to a training session. It is important to warm-up in order to decrease the risk of injury and increase performance. A warm-up must serve three main purposes: 
                                <ol><li>Increase core body temperature</li> 
                                <li>Increase heart rate</li> <li>Prime the various systems of the body to perform certain movements.</li></ol> It is very easy to increase core body temperature and heart rate, as hopping on a stationary bike for 5 minutes will do this just fine. However, mobilizing and activating the body correctly necessitates more specific requirements, and can make a true difference in performance. While you are welcome to warm up on your own if there is a method that you strongly prefer, see the Alloy Strength Warm Up Series for our recommended training preparation.

                                    This depends on a number of factors, including training experience and workout intensity. In general,
                                    the heavier the weight we are using, the longer we need to rest. A good rule of thumb is to rest 2-4
                                    minutes in between sets for the main 2 exercises in a training session, and less than 2 minutes for
                                    following exercises. It is important to autoregulate rest, and take the rest periods you need to recover
                                    and perform well, as long as you aren’t spending all day in the gym. These training sessions should
                                    typically take 60-90 minutes to complete
