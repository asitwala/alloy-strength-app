        <!-- Old set-up --> 
        <p>Strength is defined as the maximal force that a muscle or muscle groups can generate.
        Strength training uses heavy implements to induce muscular contraction, leading to increases 
        in strength, power, muscle size, and efficiency of the nervous system. Strength benefits every 
        other attribute of human performance and health.</p>

        <p>What truly sets Alloy Strength apart is the quality of coaching and programming that can be found nowhere else. We believe in simple and effective training that is progressive, goal-driven, scientifically-based, and personalized for every client.

        <p>By bringing autoregulatory training to the online world, we offer a unique opportunity that allows objective measures of advancement without the need for daily supervision. Our site functions as a coach, automatically modifying daily training sessions to fit the individual. Training stress is measured via a Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale to determine exercise set intensity, or how hard somehting feels to you at the time. The scale used in our Levels Progressionis 1-10, with a 1 signifying "little to no effort" and a 10 signifying "maximum effort."</p>

        <p>RPE scales can often be more appropriate than percentage based programming (selecting weights as a percentage of your 1 repetition max). There are many things that can throw off your percentages, such as strength adaptations in a training block, physical illness, sleep quality, diet, and myriad of other factors. Life happens, and you can't always be at your best; RPE can account for these variables, allowing you to regulate training based on how hard weight or exercises feel that day. To read more about autoregulatory training, please visit the Alloy Strength blog.</p>

        <p>We also offer an extensive Video Library to our members, which includes proper technique, coaching cues, and a detailed write-up for every exercise variation in the Alloy Strength Levels Progression. The levels progression is the exercise progression used in Alloy Strength's training system. Rather than having a "back and biceps" or "legs" or "arms and abs" training day, we are concerned with training the global movement patterns our body can perform. For each compound pattern and associated accessories, there are 25 increasingly-challenging levels.</p>

        <p>An example Strength Card, or daily training session template, and Training Calendar located on the user's homepage.</p>

        <p>A strength card is the template for a daily training session. On a strength card, you will see: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Movement patterns to be performed during the training session</li>
            <li>Level for each pattern and subsequent exercise</li>
            <li>Number of working sets and/or repetitions to be performed</li>
            <li>Desired RPE for each set</li>
            <li>Suggested weight or number of repetitions for each working set</li>
            <li>Suggested rest times in between sets if applicable</li>
            <li>Exercise tempo if applicable</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our methods speak for themselves. At various locations across the country, Alloy Strength's coaches have worked with thousands of athletes and clients, including All-Americans, 4 Division 1 National Championship teams, and World Champions. In 2017, Alloy Strength began group training sessions for the Atos Brazilian Jiu-jitsu competition team, and 1-on-1 training for Atos founder, Andre Galvao. The team captured its first IBJJF World Championship, and Professor Galvao went on to win his 5th IBJJF World Title at middle heavyweight. This level of coaching is unique in the entire BJJ community.</p>
