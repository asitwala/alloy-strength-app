            <h2>Liability of Alloy Strength</h2>
            <p>
                When using this Site, information is transmitted over a medium that may be beyond 
                the control and jurisdiction of Alloy Strength. Accordingly, Alloy Strength assumes

            </p>
            <p>
                Alloy Strength, any licensors, and any suppliers, to the fullest extent permitted by 
                law, disclaim all warranties, either express or implied, statutory or otherwise, 
                including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement

            <p>
                Without limiting the foregoing, Alloy Strength, its licensors, and its suppliers make 
                no representations or warranties about the following: the accuracy, reliability, completeness,

            <p>
                In no event shall Alloy Strength (or any of its licensors, suppliers, or third parties
